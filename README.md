# Garrote

Your new quiz app for all types of fun :)

## Introduction

On this document, Iâ€™ll be documenting everything that I learn while building the Garrote API.

## Context

Garrote is a quiz platform where you can build and participate on quizzes to play with your friends, your classroom, and anyone you want. Inspired by Kahoot, our goal is to improve our skills and develop new ones while building the project.

## Back-end

For the back-end of Garrote, we are going to use Nest.js, a framework to build scalable and efficient Node.js server-side applications.

## Database

Yet to decide.

## Front-end

The web front-end of Garrote will be made with React.js and the build tool Vite.
